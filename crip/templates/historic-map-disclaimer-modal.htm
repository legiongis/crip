                <p>There are two main issues with the interpretation of historic maps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The maps themselves may have been drawn inaccurately or approximately</li>
                        <li>The process of placing them on current maps (as shown here) <em><b>should not be considered authoritative</b></em>.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Before continuing, the user must understand that the Cane River National Heritage Area <em><b>takes no responsibility</b></em> for the relationship between features on the historic maps (property lines, structures, roads, etc.) and their <em><b>apparent</b></em> corresponding location on current maps or on the ground.  Any property lines or markings on the ground take precedence over what is displayed here.</p>
