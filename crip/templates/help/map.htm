            <p>The map has a single "basemap" layer underneath anything else in the view.  The standard Roads and Satellite layers are available, as well as two "non-standard" basemaps.
            <ul>
                <li>The USGS basemap is great for finding features from the past that do not show up on current online maps, like the community of Mink, or the old Red Dirt Lookout Tower.</li>
                <li>The Shaded Relief basemap shows a high-level of detail for all topographical features in Natchitoches Parish. This layer can be viewed in color or in black and white (click the blue circle next to it to switch color schemes).</li>
            </ul>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Not all basemaps are supported at the highest zoom levels, and they will turn on and off accordingly. If a basemap is not showing up at a high zoom level, zoom out until it does. You can also remove the basemap altogether.</p>

            <p>The ability to very historic maps is a view exciting feature of the CRHIM. These maps are presented here for research and general interest purposes, but the viewer must understand that the Cane River National Heritage Area makes no guarantee of their accuracy. It is easy to "over-interpret" historic maps, especially when they are presented on top of present-day maps as they are here. Information about each historic map can be found by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-info-circle" style="color: #65a5da;"></i> icon.</p>
            <p>When a historic map is turned on, it is added as a "layer" on top of the current basemap.  You can "stack" multiple historic maps by turning on more than one.  The most recently activated map will be placed on top of any other historic maps. To further accommodate overlay comparisons, alternate color schemes have been enabled for a few of the historic maps. Click the <i class="fa fa-circle" style="color: #65a5da;"></i> icon to explore these options.</p>

            <p>In the Overlays tab, you can add resources from the inventory.  By default, a layer showing all database resources is present, but that could be replaced with one that shows only Historic Resources, or Historic Districts.  Once you have added a layer, you can adjust its transparency.</p>
            <p>In addition to the resource overlays, a couple of reference overlays have been included.
            <ul>
                <li>Layers for vegetation in the American Cemetery</li>
                <li>Private property boundaries in Kisatchie National Forest</li>
