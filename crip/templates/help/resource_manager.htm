            <p>This is where you can edit existing resources, or create new resources if your account has the appropriate permissions.  On the left, you will see the Resource Description panel, which lists all available forms for editing/creating this resource.  Each form collects a different set of information, and the database aggregates this information to create a "resource".</p>
            <p>Creating a new resource is very easy. Here's a short guide for adding the Lemee House to the database:
            <ol>
                <li>From the Resource Manager dropdown menu, choose Historic Resource. You are now looking at an empty form, ready to record a new resource.</li>
                <li>Enter "Lemee House" in the Name box, and select what type of name this is. Select 'Primary'. Though you don't need to have one, it's best to make sure that every resource has a Primary name.  You can add as many Alternative Names as you like.</li>
                <li>Before you click Save, be sure to click Add.  You will see the name you entered get added to the list of existing names.</li>
                <li>Now click 'Save edits'. The new resource has been created, and you can see its new "Arches ID" and so far the only information attached to it is a Primary Name of 'Lemee House'.</li>
                <li>Next, add some geometry to it. Only once a resource has geometry attached to it will you be able to see it on the map. Navigate to the Location section.</li>
                <li>Below the map, you'll see a number of descriptive location types that could be added, such as Addresses or Administrative Areas. However, to add proper geometry to the resource we must use the map.</li>
                <li>Zoom into Natchitoches to locate the Lemee House on Jefferson St. (If you are looking for a historic resource, you can turn on any of the historic basemaps too!)</li>
                <li>Once you are close enough to see the location that you want to map, click the Add Geometry button, and choose what type you'd like to draw.  To make lines or polygons, just click once for each new vertex, and double-click to finish the shape.</li>
                <li>When your geometry is complete, you can select a qualifier for it if you like.</li>
                <li>Click 'Save edits', and then go check out the MAP tab to see your handiwork!</li>
            </ol>

            </p>Some of the input forms have a more advanced setup, in order to guide you through slightly more complex data collection.  Try out the Condition Assessment form or the Evaluation form to see an example of this.  Always be sure to click 'Add' before trying to save your edits.  Once you've filled in some information, you'll begin to get a better understanding of how the bar in the SEARCH tab works: each keyword that shows up in the search dropdown while you are typing is one that you can find in these forms.</p>
