            </p>Welcome to the Resource Manager! Viewing this page means that you have the ability to create new resources, or at least edit existing ones. On the left, you will see the <b>Resource Description</b> panel, which lists all available forms for adding data to this type of resource. Each form collects a different set of information, and the database aggregates this information to create a "resource". Both editing and creating are very straight-forward tasks in an Arches database, so the following tips will be enough to get you started.</p>

            <p>To create a new resource in the database, you only have to enter one piece of information about it. It could be any piece of information, but it's best to start with a name:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>From the <b>Resource Manager</b> menu, make sure your have chosen <b>Historic Resource</b>. You are now looking at an empty form, ready to record a new resource.</li>
                <li>Type "Lemee House" in the <b>Name</b> box, and select 'Primary' for the name <b>Type</b>.</li>
                <li>Click <b>Add</b> to add the new name and name type, and then click <b>Save edits</b>.</li>
                <li>Notice that at the top of the page, where it used to say "New Resource, Arches ID: n/a", it now says "Lemee House" and gives a unique identifier for the Arches ID.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Congratulations! That's all it takes to make a new resource in the database, and from here you will technically be editing it. The Name/Name Type pair is a device that you will find often.  Just be sure to always <b>Add</b> an attribute before you click <b>Save edits</b>.</p>
            <p>Next, let's add a location, so the Lemee House will show up on the map.</p> 
                <li>In the panel on the left, choose the <b>Location</b> form.</li>
                <li>There are a few different types of location information that we can enter, but to we need to add geometry for the resource to appear on the map.</li>
                <li>In the map window, zoom navigate the map to locate the Lemee House on the corner of Jefferson St. and Demeziere St. (If you are looking for a historic resource, you can turn on any of the historic maps too!).</li>
                <li>Click <b>Add Geometry</b>, and choose what geometry type you'd like to draw.  To make lines or polygons, just click once for each new vertex, and double-click to finish the shape.</li>
                <li>When your geometry is complete, you can select a qualifier for it if you like.</li>
                <li>Click 'Save edits', and then go check out the MAP tab to see your handiwork!</li>
            </ol>

            </p>Some of the input forms have a more advanced setup, in order to guide you through slightly more complex data collection.  Try out the Condition Assessment form or the Evaluation form to see an example of this.  Always be sure to click 'Add' before trying to save your edits.  Once you've filled in some information, you'll begin to get a better understanding of how the bar in the SEARCH tab works: each keyword that shows up in the search dropdown while you are typing is one that you can find in these forms.</p>
