        <p>All resources in the inventory can be found using a variety of different sorting and filtering methods, all of which are accessed right here on the SEARCH tab.</p>
        <p>To make a general search for the word "church", type the word and hit Enter. This will return any resources that are associated with the word "church". To make the search more specific, instead of hitting Enter, select a term from the dropdown list that is provided as you type the word. You will see a number of options, which should be interpreted like this: "'church' as a Heritage Resource Type", "'church' as a Keyword", etc.</p>
        <p>You can narrow your search by adding as many additional search terms to the search bar as necessary. Each new search term will be combined with any existing terms. You can remove a search term by clicking the 'x', or you can <em>reverse</em> a search--for all resources that <em>do not</em> fit the criteria--by clicking on an existing search term (it will turn red).</p>

        <p>In addition to combining multiple search terms, you can apply the Location Filter and/or Time Filter. Once enabled, these filters are added to the search bar.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Location Filter shows you a map of the area with all resources shown: red if they fit the current search filters, grey if they don't. To create a filter based on location, use the "Map Tools" to create a point, line, or polygon, and then apply a buffer to show resources that fit within a given distance of the shape. To create a line or polygon, click to create each new vertex, and double-click to finish the shape.</li>
            <li>The Time Filter allows you to only show resources that fit within a given range of dates. Use the slider to narrow or broaden the date range you are interested in viewing.</li>

        <p>Once you have created a subset of resources by using various search filters, you can export the results to a few different formats by clicking on the TOOLS button.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>.KML: This is the spatial data format used and created by <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/">Google Earth</a>, an easy-to-use free mapping program.  Google Earth includes 3-dimensional elevation data, so if you are interested in seeing resources in a 3-dimensional environment, just export your results and open the output file in Google Earth.</li>
            <li>.SHP: Shapefiles are the "industry standard" format for the exchange of spatial data, and can be viewed with all standard GIS software, such as <a href="http://www.qgis.org">Quantum GIS</a> (free), or any ESRI GIS products, like <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop">ArcGIS Desktop</a> (not free).</li>
            <li>.CSV: A Comma Separated Values file is a simple text file that can be opened as a spreadsheet in Excel, or read as a text file in any text editing software.</li>
