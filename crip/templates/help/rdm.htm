            <p>The Reference Data Manager (RDM) is where you can manage the concepts that are used behind the scenes to categorize all of the information captured in the database. While creating new resources, or editing existing resources, you will notice that most data entry is done by selecting "concepts" from predetermined dropdown lists.  The RDM is where these dropdowns are managed.</p>
            <p>In the panel on the left, you can see the 'Arches' menu, and below it, the 'Dropdown Lists' menu. The 'Arches' menu shows all of the concept schemes in the database, and the 'Dropdown Lists' menu holds the "controlled vocabularies" (groups of concepts) that are passed to the data input forms. These two menus will be used in the following guide, which is an illustration of how to add a new "Keyword" concept.</p>

                <li>Open the <b>Arches</b> menu, scroll down and select the <b>Keyword</b> concept scheme. In the right panel, you can see all of the existing concepts in the Keyword concept scheme.</li>
                <li>Click the Manage menu, and select <b>Add Child</b>.</li>
                <li>Create a new keyword ("Logging", for example) by entering it in the <b>Label</b> box. You can add a note to this concept if you like; it will be visible to anyone who views the concept in the RDM later.</li>
                <li>Click <b>Save Changes</b>. You have now added a new Keyword, and you'll see "Logging" in the list of Keyword concepts.</li>
                <li>Too add this new Keyword concept to the Keywords dropdown list (so it can be used in the creation of new resources), close the <b>Arches</b> menu, and open the <b>Dropdown Lists</b> menu.</li>
                <li>Scroll down to the <b>Keyword.E55</b> entry, and open that collection. You'll see the list of concepts that already exist in the dropdown.</li>
                <li>Click on <b>Add dropdown entry<.b>, and begin to type "Logging". The new keyword will appear in the search bar, now that it has been added to the database (steps 1-4).</li>
                <li>Select the concept, and click <b>Save</b>. The new concept "Logging" will now be available to any Keyword dropdowns.</li>
