# ~~ Welcome to the Cane River Inventory Package ~~

This app is an adaptation of the Heritage Inventory Package, developed for the Historic Places LA installation of Arches v3.  A template for historic basemaps have been added, and some basic rebranding has been carried out for the Cane River National Heritage Area.

To install use this app with Arches v3, follow the normal Arches HIP installation instructions, but instead of using the "arches-app create" command, clone this repository.
